# Boot.dev Pokedex project

## About the project

Pokedex is a REPL project that uses the (PokeAPI)[https://pokeapi.co/docs] to explore the world of Pokemon from your commandline

### Learning outcomes

This was a fun project to get some practice with API calls in Go and working with json data. It was also great to practice more Go as I'm still getting used to the language and have really started to appreciate the types and how packages work in go. I used the (figlet for go)["https://github.com/mbndr/figlet4go"] library to generate ascii art
